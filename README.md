Tweet Sentiment Analysis using ML & LSTM
This project analyzes the sentiments of tweets using both Machine Learning (Logistic Regression) and Deep Learning (LSTM) models. It focuses on classifying tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on their textual content. Preprocessing steps, feature extraction using TF-IDF, model training, evaluation, and predictions are all covered in a single notebook.
